# Java Inventory System

## Model's: Inventory, Product, & Part

### Product & Part Classes

Essentially a Product is made of Part's in this program.  The Part class is Abstract; therefore, the classe's InHouse or Outsourced extend Part, which is Inheritance, a pilar of Object Oriented Programming.

### Inventory Class

The Inventory Class is where the majority of the programming takes place in this program.

#### ExceptionUtility Class

The ExceptionUtility Class handles all of the Exception handeling of the program where it is programmed in a way that it can be used by multiple classes.

## The View & Controller Classes

Product is split into Add or Modify.  Part is also split into Add or Modify.  Other than that, the Main-Menu is the default View & Controller.
